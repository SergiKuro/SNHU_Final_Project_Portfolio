# SNHU_Final_Project_Portfolio
Overview
This repository contains the artifacts and documentation for my final project in the IT 230 Software Development with C# course. The project demonstrates my ability to work with existing code, implement changes based on software requirements, and create new functionalities using the skills and techniques I have learned.

Project Purpose
The purpose of this application is to manage student registration efficiently and effectively. It was designed to address the following user needs:

Efficient Student Registration:

Users need a straightforward and efficient way to register students for courses.
The application allows users to quickly input student details and enroll them in the desired courses, minimizing the time and effort required.
Accurate Data Management:

Users need to ensure that all student data is accurately recorded and easily retrievable.
The application provides functionality for storing, updating, and retrieving student information in a reliable and organized manner.
User-Friendly Interface:

Users need an interface that is easy to navigate, even for those with minimal technical experience.
The WPF application offers a graphical user interface (GUI) with clear labels, intuitive navigation, and helpful prompts, making it accessible to all users.
What I Did Well
During the development of this application, I excelled in:

Implementing efficient and clean code for the student registration functionality.
Designing a user-friendly interface in the WPF application that ensures ease of use for all users.
Ensuring accurate data management through thorough testing and validation.
Comparison of Console and WPF Designs
Design Differences
The application was developed in both Console and WPF formats. The Console application provided basic functionality and a straightforward user experience, while the WPF version focused on delivering a rich, user-centered UI. Key differences include:

Console Application:
Simple text-based interface.
Basic input and output functionality to register students.
WPF Application:
Graphical user interface with intuitive navigation.
Enhanced features like drop-down menus, data validation, and clear error messages.
Screens and Features
The WPF application includes several screens and features designed to support user needs:

Registration Screen: Allows users to input and submit student registration details.
Data Management Screen: Provides options for viewing, updating, or deleting student information.
Confirmation and Error Screens: Offer feedback to the user about the success of their actions or guide them to correct errors.
User-Centered Design
The design of the UI was created with the user in mind, focusing on ease of use, accessibility, and clear communication. This approach ensured that the application was both functional and user-friendly.

Debugging and Coding Strategies
Throughout the development process, I employed several strategies to debug and refine the code:

Using breakpoints and step-through debugging in Visual Studio to troubleshoot issues effectively.
Writing unit tests to validate the functionality of key components.
Refactoring code to improve readability and maintainability.
These techniques helped me efficiently identify and resolve issues, and I plan to apply them in future projects to maintain high code quality.
